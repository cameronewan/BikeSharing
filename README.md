## Summary
Based on the results, it appears that Males are the primary bike users. Morning, evening and weekends are the busiest overall and across genders. There are more male users than female. The younger users use the bikes for longer periods of time, and go further distances. 

Two additional recommendations for visualizations would be to include cost analysis. Additional data in city data could be helpful, sych as traffic, bus routes, bike lanes ect.
